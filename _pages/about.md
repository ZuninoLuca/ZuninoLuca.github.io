I am a machine learning and robotics engineer exploring how vision-language models and bio-inspired designs can make autonomous systems smarter and more efficient. Currently at Bosch Research, I develop vision-language-action (VLA) models for end-to-end autonomous driving, with a focus on computational efficiency and interpretability.

I have co-authored research published in *Science Robotics*, including a [journal cover feature](https://www.science.org/toc/scirobotics/10/107) that received [international media coverage](https://www.ansa.it/canale_scienza/notizie/frontiere/2025/11/06/da-un-robot-con-il-cervello-di-pesce-un-nuovo-approccio-allia_20cc2205-5ddc-439d-a896-d2f4d6c8c5d9.html). I've contributed to six patent disclosures in autonomous driving and vision-language model applications.

Before joining Bosch, I completed my Master’s in Robotics at EPFL. At the BioRob Laboratory, I worked on bio-inspired neural networks and neuromechanical simulations while serving as a Laboratory Guide. I also served as a Teaching Assistant for the "Evolutionary Robotics" course.
